// Config Documentation

The config folder contains the default plugin data as a backup to the main
plugin folder. chroma.io treats all user interface files as plugins, and
is packaged with a copied set of these default plugins included in the main
plugin folder.

The config folder also contains the defualt style sheet for the program,
which registers the default styles for the pre-packaged UI.

The user is free to modify, repackage, and distribute their plugins or 
plugin folder as they see fit, but are warned to exercise caution and 
attention to detail when modifying default plugins and creating new ones.

Should the user find themselves with a broken UI, they can remove their existing
plugins and replace them with a fresh copy of the default plugins from
the chroma.io website.
